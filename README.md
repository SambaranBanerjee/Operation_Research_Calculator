# 🧮 Calcify

Calcify is a modern, cross-platform Operations Research Calculator App built with React Native + Expo.
It helps students and professionals solve complex Linear Programming, Transportation, Assignment, and Network Flow problems with intuitive inputs, visualizations, and AI-like explanations — all in one app.

🚀 Features

✅ Multi-Module Solver

🧩 Linear Programming (LP) — Graphical & Simplex Method Solver

🚚 Transportation Problem — NW Corner, Least Cost, Vogel Approximation, MODI

👷 Assignment Problem — Hungarian Method for Cost Optimization

🌐 Network Flow Problem — Visual Network Builder and Flow Calculator

✅ Smart UI/UX

Dynamic input forms for each problem type

Visual outputs (graphs, network diagrams, tables) using react-native-svg

Progress tracking for each problem-solving step

✅ Offline Support

Works even without internet

Local caching of last-solved problems

✅ Cross-Platform

Works seamlessly on Android, iOS, and Web

✅ Modern Tech Stack

React Native + Expo (New Architecture enabled)

TypeScript for type safety

Tailwind (NativeWind) for UI

Modular algorithmic logic (linearProgramming.ts, transportation.ts, etc.)
